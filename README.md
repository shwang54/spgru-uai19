## Code


## Data
1. [Moving Digit MNIST](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/unsupervised_video/) from [this paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/unsup_video.pdf) is essentially built off of the traditional MNIST digits. Various properties of the sequences (e.g., directions, speed, sizes, etc.) can be adjust within the data generator.
3. Neuroimaging data (WRAP): The longitudinal neuroimaging data is a part of the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention (WRAP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
